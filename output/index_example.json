      "summary": "This conversation provides a guide to formatting CrewAI output for improved readability, data extraction, debugging, and consistency. It explains that default CrewAI outputs are often difficult to parse and provides examples of basic and advanced output formatting, including a code snippet for structuring the output. It also outlines best practices for output formatting, emphasizing consistency, error handling, readability, data extraction, and logging. The conversation concludes by offering to elaborate on specific aspects or provide more tailored examples.",

      "summary": "The conversation confirms the feasibility of creating an agent dedicated to writing reports that highlight key points, explain errors, and provide insightful analysis. The agent should be designed with a specific role (e.g., Report Writer), a goal focused on summarizing and explaining results, and a relevant backstory. It can leverage its inherent processing abilities and may need additional tools depending on data sources. The agent's task is to process execution results (logs, other agents' outputs) and generate structured reports with summaries, insights, and potentially error explanations and suggested solutions.",

Key models include the **Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental** (state-of-the-art reasoning), **Gemini 2.0 Flash** (speed and tool use), **Gemini 1.5 Pro** (mid-size multimodal with large context window), **Imagen 3** (high-quality text-to-image), and various **Gemini/Text Embedding** models. Different model version naming patterns are available (latest, latest stable, stable, experimental).  Experimental models are for feedback and are subject to change.  The models support a variety of languages. Developers are encouraged to experiment with these models in Google AI Studio.",

The AI assistant generates a draft storyline formatted as a log entry from the secret cell, highlighting their mission to expose the Party's oppressive regime and encouraging the user to join the fight. The AI concludes by summarizing the story's themes and offering the user the freedom to modify the generated text.",
